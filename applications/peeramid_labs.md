## Project Overview :page\_facing\_up:

[Anti-collusion infrastructure RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/anti-collusion_infrastructure.md)

### Overview

- **Tagline:** Tokenomics research on novel ways to decouple speculative investment from governance power and foster more effective, collusion-resistant, decentralized organizations.  
- **Description**: This project aims to refine our research on a novel, decentralized protocol for identifying and ranking competence within DAOs. We will explore token engineering and how today's privacy-preserving techniques can address challenges and opportunities within the DAO and Polkadot ecosystem.  
- **Integration with Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama**: This research will benefit the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems by providing a deeper understanding of DAO governance challenges and proposing solutions for Substrate-based chains. While not directly implementing a Substrate pallet in this grant, the findings will prepare the way for future integrations.  
- **Interest:** We are passionate about advancing decentralized governance and empowering communities through robust and transparent decision-making mechanisms. This research aligns with our commitment to building a more equitable and efficient Web3 ecosystem.  
- **Research Type**: This project will result in a refined and expanded research paper, potentially leading to publications in peer-reviewed venues and presentations at relevant conferences.

### Project Details

**Problems to Investigate**:

- **Limitations of current DAO governance:** Many face challenges with low participation, centralization risks, and the need for more nuanced competence assessment.  
- **Interoperability in DAOs:** Ability to create autonomous working groups in decentralized manner and analyze trust assumptions for their interactions.  
- **Challenges and opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem:** Understanding the governance landscape of Substrate-based chains and identifying areas for improvement.

**Research Questions/Hypothesis**:

- **Hypothesis 1:** *Governance can be decoupled from speculative component (Sub-linear governance power dependency from capital input)*  
- **Hypothesis 2:** *Existing cryptography and privacy-preserving features may improve governance processes.*  
- **Hypothesis 3:** *The current governance state is susceptible to speculations and has low participation rates and quorum thresholds.*  
- **Hypothesis 4:** *Designing merit-oriented protocols can improve participation rates.*

**Methodology**:

- Review literature and research on novel voting systems.  
- Propose a system to decouple token utility from governance without affecting established structures.  
- Run a community survey for feedback on the likelihood of using the technology.  
- Publish results as a paper & dataset for any analytics.

**Data Collection and Analysis Procedures**:

- Analyze existing research on decentralized governance.  
- Gather and analyze data from the Polkadot community, including opinions of stakeholders, vendors, DOT holders, and builders. This will involve surveys on the Polkadot forum, Telegram groups, and Twitter polls, as well as outreach to key stakeholders and vendors.  
- Create financial models and run game theoretic analysis. Game theoretic models will assess collusion potential and identify strategies to mitigate risks.

**Expected Results:**

- A refined research paper refining our findings into a token mechanics model.  
- A deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities for applying competence identification and ranking protocols in Substrate-based chains.  
- Potential contributions to the Web3 community through publications, presentations, and open-source tools.

- [Achieving Unbiased Decision-Making in DAOs: A Privacy-Preserving Approach](https://mirror.xyz/peersky.eth/c0nrRVoKdbeenAlKVOn5gGfir06Wy-wrSuCONMZUO30)

**Intended Venue for Publication:**

- Pre-print server (e.g., arXiv)  
- Potential publication in peer-reviewed journals (e.g., IEEE Security & Privacy, ACM CCS).  
- Presentation at relevant conferences and workshops (e.g., Web3 Summit, Polkadot Decoded).

**Limitations**:

- This project focuses on research and analysis, not on developing a production-ready protocol implementation.  
- This grant does not encompass direct integration with Substrate, but the research will inform future development within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Fit into the Ecosystem:**

- The project enhances governance mechanisms in Substrate-based blockchains, providing a robust competence identification system for DAOs. **Target Audience:**  
    
- Parachain developers, app developers, governance researchers, and DAO participants.  
    
- **Needs Met:**  
    
  - Reliable Frameworks for improved participation rates, reduced centralization, and enhanced security in DAO governance.

**Similar Projects:**

There are no similar projects in the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. However, related ones in other ecosystems focus on decentralized governance and cryptographic voting systems. [Conviction voting](https://blog.giveth.io/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) is a similar concept, which we elaborate to state of *conviction election.*
